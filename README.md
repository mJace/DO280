# 3. Configuring Authentication

## Users

### Regular users

This is the way most interactive OpenShift Container Platform users are represented. Regular users are created automatically in the system upon first login or can be created via the API. Regular users are represented with the User object. Examples: joe alice

### System users

Many of these are created automatically when the infrastructure is defined, mainly for the purpose of enabling the infrastructure to interact with the API securely. They include a cluster administrator (with access to everything), a per-node user, users for use by routers and registries, and various others. Finally, there is an anonymous system user that is used by default for unauthenticated requests. Examples: system:admin system:openshift-registry system:node:node1.example.com

### Service accounts

These are special system users associated with projects; some are created automatically when the project is first created, while project administrators can create more for the purpose of defining access to the contents of each project. Service accounts are represented with the ServiceAccount object. Examples: system:serviceaccount:default:deployer system:serviceaccount:foo:builder

## Groups

### system:authenticated

Automatically associated with all authenticated users.

### system:authenticated:oauth

Automatically associated with all users authenticated with an OAuth access token.

### system:unauthenticated

Automatically associated with all unauthenticated users.

# Controlling Access to Openshift Resources


## Authorization Process
The authorization process is managed by rules, roles, and bindings.

|RBAC Object	| Description |
|-------------|:-----------|
|Rule|	Allowed actions for objects or groups of objects|
|Role	|Sets of rules. Users and groups can be associated with multiple roles.|
|Binding |	Assignment of users or groups to a role.|


RBAC Scope
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) defines two groups of roles and bindings depending on the scope and responsibility of users: cluster roles and local roles.

|Role Level	| Description |
|-----------|-------------|
|Cluster Role	| Users or groups with this role level can manage the OpenShift cluster.|
|Local Role	| Users or groups with this role level can only manage elements at a project level.|

## Managing RBAC Using the CLI

- oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user __cluster-role__ __username__
- oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-user __cluster-role__ __username__

## Default Roles
OpenShift ships with a set of default cluster roles that can be assigned locally or to the entire cluster. You can modify these roles for fine-grained access control to OpenShift resources, but additional steps are required that are outside the scope of this course.

| Default roles	|Description |
|---------------|------------|
|admin	| Users with this role can manage all project resources, including granting access to other users to the project.|
|basic-user |	Users with this role have read access to the project.|
|cluster-admin	| Users with this role have superuser access to the cluster resources. These users can perform any action on the cluster, and have full control of all projects.|
|cluster-status	| Users with this role can get cluster status information.|
| edit	| Users with this role can create, change, and delete common application resources from the project, such as services and deployment configurations. These users cannot act on management resources such as limit ranges and quotas, and cannot manage access permissions to the project.|
|self-provisioner	| Users with this role can create new projects. This is a cluster role, not a project role.|

- oc adm policy add-role-to-user role-name __username__ -n __project__
- oc adm policy add-role-to-user basic-user dev -n wordpress
view	Users with this role can view project resources, but cannot modify project resources.

## Managing Sensitive Information with Secrets

### Creating a Secret
- oc create secret generic __secret_name__ --from-literal key1=secret1 --from-literal key2=secret2
- Update the pod service account to allow the reference to the secret. to allow a secret to be mounted by a pod running under a specific service account
- oc secrets add --for mount serviceaccount/__serviceaccount-name__ secret/__secret_name__

### Secrets as Pod Environment Variables
```
env:
  - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: demo-secret
        key: root_password
```        
- oc set env dc/demo --from=secret/__demo-secret__
### Secrets as Files in a Pod
- oc set volume dc/demo --add --type=secret --secret-name=demo-secret --mount-path=/app-secrets

- oc create secret generic mysql --from-literal user=myuser --from-literal password=redhat123 --from-literal database=test_secrets --from-literal hostname=mysql 
- oc new-app --name mysql --docker-image registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/mysql-57-rhel7:5.7-47
- oc set env dc/mysql --prefix MYSQL_ --from secret/mysql
```
spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:

              name: mysql
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              key: user
              name: mysql

## Controlling Application Permissions with Security Context Constraints(SCCs)

Red Hat OpenShift provides security context constraints (SCCs), a security mechanism that restricts access to resources, but not to operations in OpenShift.

SCCs limit the access from a running pod in OpenShift to the host environment. SCCs control:

- Running privileged containers
- Requesting extra capabilities to a container
- Using host directories as volumes
- Changing the SELinux context of a container
- Changing the user ID

```
$ oc get scc
OpenShift provides eight SCCs:

anyuid

hostaccess

hostmount-anyuid

hostnetwork

node-exporter

nonroot

privileged

restricted

# Chapter 5. Configuring OpenShift Networking Components

## OpenShift Software-defined Networking
- oc describe dns.operator/default
- oc get  Network.config.openshift.io cluster 

## Controlling Cluster Network Ingress

### Describing Methods for Managing Ingress Traffic
- Ingress (resource). The Ingress Operator manages this resource. Ingresses accept external requests and proxy them based on the route. You can only route HTTP, HTTPS and server name identification (SNI), and TLS with SNI.

- External load balancer (service type). This resources instructs OpenShift to spin up a load balancer in a cloud environment. A load balancer instructs OpenShift to interact with the cloud provider in which the cluster is running to provision a load balancer.

- Service external IP (service type). This method instructs OpenShift to set NAT rules to redirect traffic from one of the cluster IPs to the container.

- NodePort (service type). With this method, OpenShift exposes a service on a static port on the node IP address. You must ensure that the external IP addresses are properly routed to the nodes.

### Describing Route Options and Route Types
#### OpenShift Secure Routes
- Edge
- Pass-through
- Re-encryption
-  oc create route edge --service api-frontend --api.apps.acme.com --key api.key --cert api.crt
#### Creating Insecure Routes
-  oc expose service api-frontend

### extra notes 
- If you have HTTP/HTTPS, use an Ingress Controller.
- If you have a TLS-encrypted protocol other than HTTPS. For example, for TLS with the SNI header, use an Ingress Controller.
- Otherwise, use a Load Balancer, an External IP, or a *NodePort*.

### create CSR and Key

#### generates an RSA private key

- openssl genrsa -out `training.key` 2048

#### generate certificate signing request CSR

- openssl req -new -key `training.key` -out training.csr

#### generate signed certificate

- openssl x509 -req -in `training.csr` -passin file:passphrase.txt -CA training-CA.pem -CAkey training-CA.key -out training.crt -extfile training.ext
